### Hi  ðŸ‘‹

I work with early-staged B2B startups building in Web3 & AI.

Currently, I'm the director of [w3forge](https://w3forge.xyz) and a Cofounder/Partner at the [O2XC Venture Fund](https://o2xc.capital).

I was previously the first hire at [VEMP](https://vemp.xyz), and I've worked for [IOHK](https://iohk.io/), [Gear Tech](https://gear-tech.io/) and a few smaller startups.

I don't come from a technical background, but day by day, I'm learning.

I'm currently working on my front-end proficiency.
